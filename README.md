This console application simulates a political election system.    
It allows voters to log in to their accounts, cast their votes, and view their voting results.  
Additionally, there is a "Result Handler" account that provides access to view the overall election results.    

The system is built on two database tables and incorporates encryption techniques (AES and SHA) to address Zero Knowledge Proof challenges, ensuring secure and private voting.
